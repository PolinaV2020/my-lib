  {"id": 1, "title": "'My Monticello' Is a Stunning Collection of Dark Love Letters to Home", 
  "author": "Cybil", "text": "When it comes to writing, Jocelyn Johnson is about that life. The Virginia native—born, bred, and wed—has had aspirations of being a published author since she was a child. And, I know, many authors say that, but you need look no further for proof than this tweet of Johnson’s first author photo, taken at the ripe age of seven. Still, the road to publishing wasn’t without its many potholes. Even after gaining the representation of an agent, her first two manuscripts didn’t lead to book deals. The main obstacle then,” as Johnson tells it, “was deciding whether to keep doing it or not.” Fortunately for us, she didn’t give up, and this tenacity to achieve her lifelong dream culminated in her debut short story collection, My Monticello, which includes five captivating short stories and a knockout novella. My Monticello, as you’ll soon read more about, was born out of Johnson’s need to make sense of what happened in her hometown of Charlottesville on August 12, 2017. “A very stark event,” she calls it. With Virginia as the setting, this collection focuses on everyday individuals on the pursuit for life, liberty, and happiness, not only allowing us to see ourselves reflected in their stories, but also reminding us that perhaps the strongest weapon any one person can wield against hate is that of hope. In addition to this theme of hope, Johnson spoke with Goodreads contributor and author of Black Buck Mateo Askaripour about writing with intention, Virginia, and some of the books she’ll never forget. Their conversation has been edited. Goodreads: There’s so much going on in My Monticello. When I read “Control Negro,” I said, “Yo, YO!” That story. Ah, man. It just spoke to me in so many ways. It reminded me of how John A. Williams, and people like Chester Himes, wrote this fantastic type of fiction in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s. Just the whole conceit, and how the main character was performing a social experiment on his son from afar. So cool. And “Something Sweet on Our Tongues,” which was really funny, but also sad. I remember what it was like being a Black kid in school, the shenanigans boys get into, and what it feels like to see that kid, who’s left out or different. Whew. So, first question: What was your intention with this collection? Jocelyn Nicole Johnson: That’s a good question. I had two big things that were important to me. One is just that I’m a native Virginian, and a Black woman in Virginia, at that. These stories are kind of a weird, dark love letter to Virginia because I grew up here, I was born here, I went to school in the Shenandoah Valley, I live in Charlottesville, I got married and started my family here, and there are things I know about Virginia, places I’m familiar with—so I wanted to include a lot of that in this book. It’s what I know, it’s what I can speak to with some sort of authority. Also, on the darker side, it’s this almost vengeful response to these really obscene, brutal, and racist things that have happened here, in Charlottesville, particularly over the last couple of years. Places where I’ve felt excluded from this idea of home, here in Virginia, so I was thinking about those two things, side by side.",

  {"id": 2, "title": "Love Grows Up in the New Aristotle and Dante Novel", "author": "Cybil", "text": "Benjamin Alire Sáenz, author of Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe and many other award-winning YA and children's books, digs deeper into the growing pains and beauty of love in Aristotle and Dante Dive into the Waters of the World. Aristotle and Dante met at a swimming pool in Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe and thought they had nothing in common—until they fell in love. Since meeting Dante, Ari has become more outspoken and ready to make his voice heard. And Dante has continued to be a dreamer, something that fills Ari with both annoyance and desire. Now, in this sequel during their senior year of high school, they have to navigate how to stay in love when the world doesn’t make being queer easy. But when Ari experiences a major loss, he has to fight to create a life that is unapologetically joyous and his own. Both tender and gut-wrenching, this sequel explores how love can make you question if it’s even worth it while also fulfilling you. Goodreads contributor Arriel Vinson interviewed Sáenz about growth, desire, and what optimistic love stories can look like.",
